Just a project for me to get to know to VSCode API and how to use it.

This plugin is completely useless and started as an injoke with my friends.
Every time you press enter (newline key) it will automatically add a random number of indents to your code.
This was prompted by everyone in my friendgroup not being able to agree on an indent style, whether it be 2 spaces, 4 spaces,
or whatever else. So this plugin solves that by completely randomizing it.

If for some reason you want to install it, you can find it here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterStrizhev.random-tabs
